	\section{Introduction}
		\indent The era of the Internet of things we are currently living in is still
		improving and everyone owning a means to access Internet can express onself.
		Data published in any way on the network is stored somewhere and can be
		identified. That identification procedure usually includes retrieving more
		information than one can see when posting something. Those pieces of
		information can be anything: IP address, geo-localization, name of the web
		browser and name of the operating system used are few instances. To put it in
		a nutshell, from each data set can be extracted a lot of information which anybody who is provided an access to can do analytics on.\\
		\indent The current context enables to use previously unavailable information
		and create services as to improve users' experience when connected to the
		network. Information about tourists' movements, for instance, could allow
		companies and public institutions to do the necessary so that travelers and
		tourists have a better experience, and even prevent them from doing
		unnecessary expenses. However, useful information cannot be accessed in a
		direct way: it must be extracted. Having at disposal an extracting information
		means which could process huge data sets would be indeed a useful tool in
		order to analyze such data.\\
		\indent For this research topic, we have chosen to output a table with
		relevant attributes. Our table will be filled by analyzing huge data sets of
		tweets which are also used by the \emph{twiqs.nl} website. From each tweet can
		be extracted useful pieces of information, in particular, geolocalization
		details. Some papers propose their method to find users' hometowns like the
		Principal Components Analysis mentionned in \cite{1}. As for the technology to
		be used to approach this research topic, Pig Latin, over the Hadoop cluster,
		is the most suited. User defined functions will also be implemented in order
		to increase its efficiency in our favor.
		
	\section{Materials and methods}
		The tweets from \emph{twiqs.nl} are provided in a compressed JSON format -
		\emph{GZIP} -, thus requiring to have a proper class so that information can
		directly be read from the compressed format. The \emph{JsonLoader}
		class created by Twitter - \emph{Elephant Bird} project - could be a method to deal with the
		issue. However, this implies using Java as programming language to define user
		defined functions. Preferring untyped programming language, we decided to use
		Python instead. Using the latter, we defined the Mapper and Reducer classes so
		that the MapReduce operation can be executed over the Hadoop cluster on the
		huge data sets of tweets. For each tweet, many pieces of information can be
		retrieved using its attributes: for our research question, we decided to focus
		on the names of the destinations. As for what can be considered as a
		trip destination for a given movement, if the \emph{city} attribute value is
		different from the location from which the tweet was written, then it is a
		trip destination. Then, counting the number of occurrences for each city using
		a map enables to output the total number of visitors for any town.
		
	\section{Results and discussion}
		As final result, we produced a table giving, for each dutch city, the number
		of tweeters who went there on a given day. This table can be used to
		determine, for instance, the most visited place in the Netherlands during the
		Christmas period. Graphical representations are also much easily possible
		thanks to our final result. Running out ot time, we did not have time to
		implement one. In order to state the legitimacy of our data, it could have
		been great to compare to an official source.

	\section{Conclusion}
		Our table enables to answer the research question at different levels, and
		using graphical representations is the best way for users to determine when
		and where to go to places not crowded. Adding legitimacy to our data by
		comparing it to official sources would give more righteousness to our computations.
