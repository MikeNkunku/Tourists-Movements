	\section{Introduction}
		\indent The era of the Internet of things we are currently living in is still
		improving and everyone owning a means to access Internet can express onself.
		Data published in any way on the network is stored somewhere and can be
		identified. That identification procedure usually includes retrieving more
		information than one can see when posting something. Those pieces of
		information can be anything: IP address, geo-localization, name of the web
		browser and name of the operating system used are few instances. To put it in
		a nutshell, from each data set can be extracted a lot of information which anybody who is provided an access to can do analytics on.\\
		\indent The current context enables to use previously unavailable information
		and create services as to improve users' experience when connected to the
		network. Information about tourists' movements, for instance, could allow
		companies and public institutions to do the necessary so that travelers and
		tourists have a better experience, and even prevent them from doing
		unnecessary expenses. However, useful information cannot be accessed in a
		direct way: it must be extracted. Having at disposal an extracting information
		means which could process huge data sets would be indeed a useful tool in
		order to analyze such data.\\
		\indent For this research topic, we have chosen to output a table with
		relevant attributes. Our table will be filled by analyzing huge data sets of
		tweets which are also used by the \emph{twiqs.nl} website. From each tweet can
		be extracted useful pieces of information, in particular, geolocalization
		details. Some papers propose their method to find users' hometowns like the
		Principal Components Analysis mentionned in paper[1]. As for the technology to
		be used to approach this research topic, Pig Latin, over the Hadoop cluster,
		is the most suited. User defined functions will also be implemented in order
		to increase its efficiency in our favor.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% and a .pdf suffix will be assumed for pdflatex; or what has been declared
% via \DeclareGraphicsExtensions.
%\caption{Simulation Results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure}

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%
%\begin{figure*}[!t]
%\centerline{\subfloat[Case I]\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase1}%
%\label{fig_first_case}}
%\hfil
%\subfloat[Case II]{\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{subfigcase2}%
%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.



\section{Conclusion}
\blindtext





% if have a single appendix:
%\appendix[Proof of the Zonklar Equations]
% or
%\appendix  % for no appendix heading
% do not use \section anymore after \appendix, only \section*
% is possibly needed

% use appendices with more than one appendix
% then use \section to start each appendix
% you must declare a \section before using any
% \subsection or using \label (\appendices by itself
% starts a section numbered zero.)
